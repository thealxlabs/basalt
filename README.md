# Basalt

> **Learn the Stack.**

A minimalist stack-oriented programming language designed to teach the fundamentals of stack-based computing. No parentheses. No indentation. No noise — just the pure mechanics of a stack.

## What is Basalt?

Basalt strips programming down to its **raw fundamentals**. Every operation is an explicit manipulation of a single data structure — the stack. There are no hidden abstractions, no syntactic sugar hiding complexity. What you see is exactly what the interpreter executes.

Written in **Python 3** with a custom-built Lexer and Parser, Basalt is fully open source. You can read every line of the interpreter and trace exactly how your code is processed — from raw text to executed output.

## Features

- **Stack-Oriented**: All computation flows through a single stack. Push values, apply operations, read results — no variable declarations needed.
- **Zero Noise**: No parentheses, no indentation, no semicolons. Basalt's syntax is intentionally stripped bare so you focus on the stack.
- **Fully Transparent**: The entire interpreter is open source. Trace how the lexer tokenizes input, how the parser builds structure, and how each instruction executes.
- **Learn by Doing**: Basalt is purpose-built for learning. Master stack manipulation, understand how real low-level systems work, build from the ground up.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oberhalsi/basalt.git
cd basalt
```

2. Run your first program:
```bash
python main.py tests/math.b
```

### Your First Program

Create a file called `hello.b`:

```basalt
# Push two numbers and add them
7 42 + print

# Output: 49
```

Run it:
```bash
python main.py hello.b
```

## Examples

### Basic Arithmetic

```basalt
# tests/math.b
7 42 + print     # → 49
100 37 - print   # → 63
6 8 * print      # → 48
144 12 / print   # → 12
17 5 % print     # → 2
```

### Factorial (Recursion)

```basalt
# tests/factorial.b
def factorial
  dup 1 >
  if
    dup 1 - factorial *
  else
    pop 1
  end
end

5 factorial print  # → 120
```

### Stack Manipulation

```basalt
10 dup              # stack: [10 10]
print print         # prints: 10, then 10

1 2 swap            # stack: [2 1]
print print         # prints: 1, then 2

3 4 over            # stack: [3 4 3]
print print print   # prints: 3, 4, 3
```

## Language Reference

### Stack Operations
- `push <val>` - Push a value onto the stack
- `pop` - Remove and discard the top element
- `dup` - Duplicate the top element
- `swap` - Swap the top two elements
- `over` - Copy the second element to the top
- `rot` - Rotate the top three elements

### Math Operations
- `+` - Addition
- `-` - Subtraction
- `*` - Multiplication
- `/` - Integer division
- `%` - Modulo
- `==` - Equality check
- `<` - Less than
- `>` - Greater than

### I/O Operations
- `print` - Pop and print the top value
- `println` - Pop and print with newline
- `input` - Read input and push to stack

### Control Flow
- `if ... else ... end` - Conditional execution
- `while ... end` - Loop while condition is true
- `def name ... end` - Define a function

### String Operations
- `"text"` - String literal
- `concat` - Concatenate two strings
- `len` - Get string length
- `tostr` - Convert to string

## Architecture

Basalt's interpreter follows a simple pipeline:

```
Source File (.b) → Lexer → Parser → Interpreter → Output
```

1. **Lexer** (`src/lexer.py`) - Tokenizes source code
2. **Parser** (`src/parser.py`) - Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
3. **Interpreter** (`src/interpreter.py`) - Executes the AST, managing the stack
